2. General
----------
SnK HotkeySuite is written using C++11 and requires at least Windows NT4.
General compilation steps:

    1) Download sources from https://github.com/lcferrum/snk_hotkeysuite

    2) Compile it using makefile

    3) SnK itself is not included - download precompiled binaries or build it
       from the sources

3. Specific compiling instructions
----------------------------------
Current distribution only supports MinGW-w64 and Clang 3.6.2. If you intend to
use compiled binary on Windows 2000 and later, it is recommended to compile
using latest MinGW-w64 that can be installed through cygwin. The problem is
that MinGW-w64 uses MSVCRT.DLL version incompatible with NT4. If you want
resulting binaries to support this OS, you should use old version of 
MinGW/Clang combination (latest verions to support needed MSVCRT.DLL are 4.7.2
and 3.6.2 accordingly). MinGW 4.7.2 itself is not supported (because it's C++11
support lacks some features used by the sources) but is needed for the Clang.
Windows 9x and pre-NT4 versions are not supported in either case.

Support for building installer is also inluded in makefile. For this to work
you should install NSIS and make sure that makensis is availabe to make
utility.

It's not recommended to pack resulting binaries with UPX because it slightly
lowers HotkeySuite performance.

To build just binary, when using MinGW-w64 from under cygwin, switch to source
directory and type (for x86 build):

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86

Or, for x86-64 build:

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86-64
	
To build x86 binary with Clang 3.6.2 type the following:

    make BUILD=Clang_362 HOST=x86
